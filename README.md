# DeepLearningModels-From-Scratch
Trying out coding deep learning models from scratch without using any DL framework for trivial math functions.

1. Feed Forward Neural Network :: XOR of two numbers.
2. Recurrent Neural Network :: Counting set bits in a binary rep. of a number
3. Recurrent Neural Network :: Addition of two numbers (using binary rep.)
